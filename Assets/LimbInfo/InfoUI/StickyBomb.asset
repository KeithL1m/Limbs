  limbName: Honey Bomb
  limbDescription: Unique to this adhesive artillery, the honey bomb is a prime option
    when it comes to sticking deadly explosives to the heads of your unsuspecting
    friends. But beware of honey bombs not stuck to players... If you run overtop
    of one that isn't attached to anything, it'll become attached to you.
