  limbName: POW Glove
  limbDescription: 'The POW Glove is a spring-loaded fist that is sure to send you
    AND your fellow meatheads flying. Shoot this limb in any direction for an immediate
    burst of momentum, but remember that it''ll boost you in the opposite direction
    too... Authors note: Aiming downward when using this limb will give the user
    an explosive one-time-use ''rocket jump''.'
